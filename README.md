Sphero
===

Unofficial Go library for the Sphero.

Some commands are still missing but all of the structure is in place to fill in the remaining commands.

Support

* Functional on OS X and may work on linux but is untested.
* Windows support is iffy: I'm using a [modified version](https://github.com/Freeflow/goserial) of [tarm's goserial](https://github.com/tarm/goserial) to provide timeouts but I didn't make the equivalent changes for Windows.
