Sphero
===

Unofficial Go library for the Sphero.

`go get github.com/FreeFlow/sphero`

Support
---

* Functional on OS X and may work on linux but is untested.
* Windows support is iffy: I'm using a [modified version](https://github.com/Freeflow/goserial) of [tarm's goserial](https://github.com/tarm/goserial) to provide timeouts but I didn't make the equivalent changes for Windows.
